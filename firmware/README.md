A generic teensy firmware used on many of my projects. This version has been 
adapted for use on the easy e-stop project. 

This code is largely based on Balto's
steering code for the CoSTAR team, and uses a serial communication protocal
outlined in SERIAL.ino


Dependencies:
 - Adafruit PWM Servo Driver Library (Arduino)
